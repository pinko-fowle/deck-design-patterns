export const halves = `Volume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume 2, A Pattern
	Language, are two halves of a single work. This book provides a language, for building
	and planing; the other book provides the theory and instruction for the use of the
	language. This book describes the detailed patterns for towns nd neighborhoods, houses,
	gardens, and rooms. The other book explains the discipline which makes it possible to
	use these patterns to create a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of the
	timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.`

export const practiclLanguage = `In this book, we present one possible pattern language of
	the kind called for in The Timeless Way. The language is extremely practical. It is a
	language that we have distilled from our own building and planning efoorts over the
	lats eight years. You can use it to work with your neighbors, to improve your town and
	neighborhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself, with your family; or to
	work with other people to design an office or a workshop or a public building like a
	school. And you can use it to guide you in the process of construction.`

export const elementsOfLanguage = `The elements of this language are entities called
	patterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our
	environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a
	way that you can use this solution a million times without ever doing it the same way
	twice.`


export const elements = {
	generalWay: `Each solution is stated in such a way that it gives the essential field
		of the relationships needed to solve the problem, but in a very general and
		abstract way- so that you can solve the problem yourself, in your own way,
		by adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions at the place you
		where you are making it.`,
	imposeNothing: `For this reason, we have tried to write each solution in a way which
		imposes nothing on you. It contains only those essentials which can not be avoided
		if you really want to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried, in each
		solution, to capture the invariant property common to all palces which succeed in
		solving the problem.`,
	profound: `But of course, we have not always succeeded. The solutions we have given to
		these problems vary in significance. Some are more true, more profound, more
		certain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked every pattern, in the
		text itself, with two asterisks, or one asterisk, or no asterisks.`
	trueInvariant: `In the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe that we have
		succeeded in stating a true invariant: in short, that the solution we have stated
		summarizes a _property_ common to _all possible ways_ of solving the stated
		problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe, in short, that it is not possible
		to solve the stated problem properly, without shaping the environment in one way or
		another according to the pattern we have given- and that, in these cases, the
		pattern descrives a deep and inescapable proeprty of a well-formed environment.`
}

export const alive = {
	hypothesis: `You see then that the patterns are very much alive and evolving. In
		fact, if you like, each pattern may be looked upon as a hypothesis like one of the
		hypothesis of science.`,
	guess: `In this sense, each pattern represents our current best guess as to what
		arrangement of the physical environment will work to solve the problem presented.
		The empirical questions center on the problem- does it occur and is it felt in the
		the way we have described it? - and the solution - does the arrangement we propose
		in fact resolve the problem?`,
	faith: `And the asterisks represent our degree of faith in these hypotheses.`
}

export const statusOfLang = `Let us finally explain the status of this language, why we have
	called it "A Pattern Language" with the emphasis on the word "A," and how we imagine
	this pattern language might be related to countless thousands of other languages we
	hope people will make for themselves, in the future`
export const aliveSociety = `The Timeless Way of Building says that every society which is
	alive and whole, will have it's own unique and distinct pattern language; and further,
	that every individual in such a society will have a unique language, shared in part,
	but which as a totality is unique to the mind of the person who has it.`

export const joy = `We have spent years trying to formulate this language, in the hope
	that when a person uses it, he will be so impressed by it's power, and so joyful in
	it's use, that he will understand again, what it means to have a living language of
	this kind. If we only succeed in that, it is possible that each person may once again
	embark upon the contruction and development of his own language- perhaps taking the
	language printed in this book, as a point of departure.`
export const archetypal = `And yet, we do believe, of course, that this language which is
	printed here is something more than a manual, or a teacher, or a version of a possible
	pattern language. Many of the patterns here are archetypal- so deep, so deeply rooted
	in the nature of things, that it seems likely that they will be a part of human
	nature, and human action, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.`
export const archetypal2 = `In this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep as we
	are able, into the nature of things in the environment: and hope that a great part of
	this language, which we print here, will be a core of any sensible human pattern
	language, which any person constructs for himself, in his own mind. In this sense, at
	least part of the language we have presented here, is the archetypal core of all
	possible pattern languages, which can make people feel alive and human.`
